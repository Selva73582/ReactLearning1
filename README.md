# React Learning Project 1

Welcome to my React learning project! In this project, I've implemented a simple color-changing application using React. Users can enter any color name in the input box, and the square box will automatically change to that color.

## Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://65eb002adcd6138563f0302f--lighthearted-conkies-af23a3.netlify.app/).

## What I've Learned

- **React Hooks:** Utilized React Hooks to manage state and lifecycle events efficiently.

- **File Handling in React:** Explored basic file handling techniques within a React application.

- **Hosting in Netlify:** Deployed the project on Netlify for easy access and sharing. The live demo is hosted [here](https://65eb002adcd6138563f0302f--lighthearted-conkies-af23a3.netlify.app/).
